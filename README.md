# Real-time-SuperCollider-course

This repository contains code I used when teaching live computer music class at the University of Washington.

While aiming to be a universal starting point for real-time work in SC, this class gravitates heavily towards a concept of sound generating/processing "modules", that would be turned on and off throughout the course of the piece. It was also considering students already being familiar with SuperCollider in general and with creating fixed-media pieces, particularly using CtkScore.

Please note, this code was last updated in 2016 and some things might not work as expected anymore. I have also changed some code organizing preferences since, however most concepts should still be useful to start making at least a particular style of real-time music works in SuperCollider.
